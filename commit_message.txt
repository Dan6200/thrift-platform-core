feat(media): Refactor and enhance media management for products and avatars

- Split the generic `/media` API route into dedicated `/media/products` and `/media/avatar` endpoints.
- Introduced new controllers (`avatar.ts`, `products.ts`) and routes for handling product and avatar media separately.
- Implemented `createAvatarQuery` for uploading and associating user avatars with profiles.
- Renamed `uploadProductMediaQuery` to `createProductMediaQuery` for clarity.
- Refactored integrated tests to cover both product and avatar media uploads, updating test definitions and the main test runner.
- Enhanced `bulkDeleteImages` utility to support targeted deletion of product or avatar images.
- Added `media_mcp_client.py`, likely a client for interacting with the new media management system.

This refactoring improves the organization, clarity, and functionality of the media management system, providing distinct handling for product and avatar uploads.
